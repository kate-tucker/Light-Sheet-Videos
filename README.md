This repository contains files of the videos taken during my ultramicroscopy research from September 2024-April 2025. The videos depict the movement of particles illuminated using a light sheet. The particles shown come from either a sample of pure water (Control) or a sample of dilutely concentrated pure water and carbon nanoparticles (Dilute). The naming convention of the videos follows "Type of Sample-Lens-Objective Used-Order in Sequence".
